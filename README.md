# Pre-requisites

In order to develop and build "My Dapp," the following pre-requisites must be installed:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (or any IDE for editing Javascript)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (DappStarter uses [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces))
* [Flow CLI](https://docs.onflow.org/docs/cli) (https://docs.onflow.org/docs/cli) (after installation run `flow cadence install-vscode-extension` to enable code highlighting for Cadence source files)

# Installation

Using a terminal (or command prompt), change to the folder containing the project files and type: `yarn` This will fetch all required dependencies. The process will take 1-3 minutes and while it is in progress you can move on to the next step.

# Yarn Errors

You might see failures related to the `node-gyp` package when Yarn installs dependencies.
These failures occur because the node-gyp package requires certain additional build tools
to be installed on your computer. Follow the [instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) for adding build tools and then try running `yarn` again.

# Build, Deploy and Test
Using a terminal (or command prompt), change to the folder containing the project files and type: `yarn start` This will run all the dev scripts in each project package.json.
