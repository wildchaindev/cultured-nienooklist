## Dapplib

This is the folder where the majority of our custom code (as in the code we write built on what was supplied by Decentology) resides. 

The “contracts” sub-folder houses our contracts, which are the mainstay of decentralized development. We’ve created an interface to make contracts easier and more efficient to work with, but also notice that these contract files are Cadence files - that is they end in .CDC. Cadence is a language specific to smart contracts and decentralized development. There is a VSCode extension for Cadence, best installed with the command line:

```sh
brew install flow-cli
```
